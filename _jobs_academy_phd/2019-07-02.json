We care about uncertainty a lot and try to ensure that the algorithms developed not only predict the outcome but also provide error bars for the predictions. The current research areas include Deep Learning and network analysis among several others. We aim to publish (and already do) at top level conferences and journals in machine learning. Also, we conduct on-demand research for leading companies and institutions.\nThe lab leader is Dr. Maxim Panov.\n\nSamples of our recent research:\n* <https:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/1902.10350.pdf>\n* <https:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/1810.03032>\n* <https:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/1804.10653.pdf>\n* <https:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/1904.06151.pdf>\n\n\n*Job duties\/responsibilities:*\n-- Read scientific articles, analyze them, generate and validate ideas\n-- Implement machine learning algorithms\n-- Run machine learning experiments\n-- Write research papers\n-- Pass some education activities related to PhD studies (courses, ...)\n\n\n*Conditions:*\n-- Competitive salary (75k starting salary, up to 105k based on research results, bonuses possible based on participation in research and educational projects)\n-- Nice office, Skolkovo Innovation Center, Moscow (!!!<https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wreSxwZW60c>)\n-- Flexible work hours\n-- Free medical insurance\/gym\n\n*Requirements:*\n-- Significant experience with machine learning and\/or statistics\n-- Good knowledge of Python\n-- Good spoken and written English\n-- MS or BA degree in math\/CS\/physics\/engineering or a related field\n\n\n*Great if you have experience with some of:*\n-- Publishing\/contributing to good research papers (in English)\n-- Experience with deep networks\n-- Experience with network analysis\n\n\nPlease apply by sending CV to <mailto:m.panov@skoltech.ru|m.panov@skoltech.ru>, or altrav@Telegram",
