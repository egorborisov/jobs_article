        "text": "Добрый день! \n\nA PhD position is available in the Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Electrical Engineering at Czech Technical University in Prague, under the co-supervision of Drs. Vyacheslav Kungurtsev (Czech Technical University), Jakub Marecek (IBM Research -- Ireland) and Didier Henrion (LAAS-CNRS). The focus will be on semidefinite programming, which is a branch of convex optimization with extensive applications in control engineering, power systems, signal processing, and statistics. Potential topics include those related to time-dependent problems, semidefinite programming under uncertainty, distributed solvers, and solvers specialised to low-rank problem, with details to be agreed upon.\n \nCorrespondingly, we are seeking applicants with a masters degree in Mathematics or CS or related fields -- or working towards one. Funding for an internationally competitive studentship (cca. EUR 2000 per month) and travel expenses is available for four years to both EU and international applicants. A start date in September 2019 (or earlier) to be agreed upon application, due asap at <mailto:jakub.marecek@ie.ibm.com|jakub.marecek@ie.ibm.com>.
