These are assigned on hiring\nand periodically reviewed by managers to check that the level is still\nappropriate or if a promotion is warranted. Any employee can ask for a review of\ntheir level, but these happen periodically anyway even when the employee does\nnot ask for it.\n\nAccording to our [wage policy](wage_policy.md), each of these levels have a\nfixed salary that is the same for everyone in the same\n[team](engineering-teams.md) and level, with two exceptions: 1) roles that have,\ninherently, a single member 2) the role of Distinguished Engineer. Salaries are updated whenever a promotion happens.\n\n### Individual Contributor\n\nIndividual contributors are essentially all engineers that do not exercise any\nkind of management activity. They are divided in levels where promotions happen\nbased on each engineer’s merits without a limit of people being at any level.\n\n#### Intern\n\nInterns have fixed-time contracts to work on a given team or project. They are\nexpected to be learning intensively and their performance is reviewed at the end\nof their term to decide if they get an offer to become a permanent part of the\nteam, usually as Junior Engineers.\n\n#### Junior Engineer\n\nJunior Engineers are expected to be able to work autonomously on small tasks,\nfix any bug in a codebase they are already familiar with and even take ownership\nof the maintenance of small projects.\n\nJuniors will usually be promoted from internships or hired at the end of their studies.\n\n#### Engineer I\n\nEngineers (I) are able to work comfortably on small tasks without any supervision. They have \nsucceeded working on mid\/big size tasks and are able to understand the impact of their\nchanges.\n\n#### Engineer II\n\nEngineers (II) are expected to work autonomously on most tasks, create projects from\nscratch and be involved actively in design of new features.\n\n#### Engineer III\n\nEngineers (III) are expected to work autonomously on any tasks, and are expected to\nbe able to mentor other team members in small\/mid tasks.\n\n#### Senior Engineer I\n\nSenior Engineers (I) should be able to lead the design of full features, create\nand maintain any project. A Senior Engineer is expected to have significant\nspecialized expertise in some areas, as well as be able to comply with high\nquality standards when coding. Senior Engineers are also expected to mentor\nother team members as needed.\n\n#### Senior Engineer II\n\nSenior Engineers (II) have outstanding performance and higher expertise in some important areas.\n\n#### Senior Engineer III\n\nSenior Engineers (III) have a long track of success as engineers within the company and are able to provide technical steering on large parts of our projects.\n\n#### Distinguished Engineer\n\nDistinguished Engineer is reserved for Senior Engineers with outstanding expertise in a\nstrategic area, where they provide mentorship and decision-making advice. It is\nthe highest level for individual contributor roles and should be awarded with great care.\n\n### Management\n\nManagement roles in engineering have similar expectations as individual\ncontributor roles in terms of engineering skills. They, however, imply managing\na team or participate intensively in higher-level decision-making processes.\n\nDue to the nature of these roles, they are obviously limited in number, so\npromotion is not automatically available on reviews and depends on the opening\nof a new position.\n\n#### Team Lead\n\nA Team Lead is equivalent to Senior Engineer II who also manages a small team of\nengineers (less than 10 people). A Team Lead is expected to be able to plan\ncurrent and future work, provide mentorship, oversee progress of the team\nand, in general, be able to make day-to-day work smooth for everyone in the team. \nA Team Lead has also a major role in the hiring process (screening, initial calls, \ncode challenge reviews, etc).\n\n#### VP of Engineering\n\nThe VP of Engineering manages the engineering team on a daily basis. Being \nthe following the primary responsibilities:\n\n- Focused on building and delivering products\n- Grows and manages the engineering team\n- Responsible for the practices and culture of the team\n- Assessing the time it will take to deliver features (or products)\n- Delivering quality releases on a schedule\n- Manager for the leads (this includes responsibility for quarterly one-on-ones)\n- Be part of pre\/post sales when the customer requires it (occasionally customers require executive presence) \n- Delivering quarterly OKR’s for the engineering organization\n\nIs responsible to keep the CTO up to date on decisions made that impact\nthe way the team works and is structured; final decision power on these matters\nis with the VP of Engineering, but it’s expected that VP of Engineering seeks advice from the CTO when\nmaking big changes. The VP of Engineering is responsible to involve the CTO in \nmajor architecture \/ technical decisions that impact the product architecture. \n\n#### Chief Technology Officer\n\nThe CTO is ultimately responsible for running the engineering department and\nproviding global direction on development. Being the following their main responsibilities:\n\n- Have a strong vision, technology visionary of source{d}\n- Work on cutting edge prototypes for the future\n- Set the future technical direction of the company and products\n- Responsible for major long term impacting technical decisions\n- Deeply care about the quality of what we deliver and build\n- Define the product architecture\n\nCTO has final say on the product architecture but VP Of Engineering decides how, when and by\nwhom it is implemented. VPEng has decision making power over the day to day\nengineering questions that come from the leads.\n\nCTO can never be a blocker to the VPEng, any decision can always be made by\nthe VPEng to move delivering of product\/OKR’s forward e.g. in the case of\nholidays or unavailability.\n\nThe CTO \/ VP of Engineering pair can be resumed in these two phrases:\n\n&gt; “The CTO makes sure the technical approach is correct and the VP Engineering makes sure the team is correct.”\n\n&gt; “The CTO makes sure we know what to work on in 6-12 months, and the VP Engineering delivers what we need to do right now.”\n\n\n&lt;hr&gt;\n\n##### Appendix - Machine Learning Team\n\n&lt;details&gt;\n  &lt;summary&gt;The following adds on bottom of the level descriptions to clarify the requirements for ML people.&lt;\/summary&gt;\n\n#### Junior Engineer\n\nJunior Engineers should have basic experience of applying ML algorithms.\nBesides, they should be able to obtain superficial understanding of the papers.\n\n#### Engineer I\n\nEngineers (I) should have certain scientific\/ML areas of expertise.\nThere should be an intuition of which ML algorithms work best in each case.\n\n#### Engineer II\n\nEngineers (II) should obtain an in-depth understanding of the read papers\nand efficiently implement ML algorithms from them.\nThey are also expected to suggest improvements to the internal processes.\n\n#### Engineer III\n\nNo special notes.\n\n#### Senior Engineer I\n\nSenior Engineer (I) should be able to suggest and develop new ML algorithms and write new papers.\n\n#### Senior Engineer II\n\nSenior Engineers (II) should have a track of remarkable ML achievements such as\na series of successful projects at work, a recognized ML speaker profile,\nhigh rank on Kaggle, good papers or being an author of a popular ML library.\n\n&lt;\/details&gt;\n\n```",
