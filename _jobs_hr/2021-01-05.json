The company is currently in stealth mode. We will provide more information at the interview.\n\nWhat you will do:\n• Work with a team of scientists and engineers to create new machine learning and AI models for enhanced phenotype models and biological age determinants\n• Create novel architectures to solve challenging problems in machine learning using CNNs, RNNs, numerical and statistical methods\n• Work with a variety of datasets from primary bio-assays to laboratory results and insurance databases\nWho we’re looking for – Culture &amp; Values:\nFirst and foremost, we want to work with someone who is a culture fit. Our culture is obsessively:\n• Transparent – for example salaries\/equity are public; all positive and negative feedback is given publicly; all internal communications are public. We like honesty and authenticity more than politeness.\n• Truth-focused – it is really hard to keep an open mind, listen to others, escape human cognitive biases and egotistical desire to be proven right. We strive to do much better at this than the typical company.\n• Growth-focused – we want to spend each day getting better than we were yesterday, and have a plan to get even better tomorrow.\n• Personal-relationship-focused – we want to work with people we love being around.\nWe’re serious about this. If you share our values, join us.\n\nWho we’re looking for – Skills:\n• General deep learning and data processing experience on large data sets\n• Direct working knowledge of numerical methods\n• Direct experience with Convolutional Neural networks, Reinforcement Learning and federated learning and general frameworks for rapid deployment\n• Programming experience is required\n• Knowledge of cloud computing and GPU processing is required\n• Ability to process biological data is a plus\n• Image processing experience is a plus\nContacts\nVadim Pinskiy\nEmail: <mailto:v@opennano.co|v@opennano.co>",
